# Backend For The Social Recipe Application

This project was created to do the server side handling for The Social Chef frontend application. It will also be in charge of persisting data to our SQLite3 database.

We used the "thin" webserver combined with rack middle ware and Sinatra to handle the routes and Active record to handle data in the database.
